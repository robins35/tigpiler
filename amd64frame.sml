This is somewhat wasteful as a non-escaping variable doesn't need to be stored in memory and could 
just be used in the register. We don't care about the wasted space and are making this simplifying assumption
in order to not need to implement the findescapes routine and allocate things differently depending on 
whether they escape or not.

by putting a wrapper around the C function call over in the runtime system code and do any
conversion needed in the C runtime code not in our tiger compiler
