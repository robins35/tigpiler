Tested Files:
	test1.tig   // There might still be an error with allocLocal, not sure it's ever
				    giving an offset other than 0
                // Fixed initializing the array var! We think that the output provided is wrong
	test2.tig   // Essentially the same as test1
	            // Fixed some details regarding list of expressions, it is now more similar to the provided output
    test4.tig
    test8.tig
    test12.tig  // FIXED! (Either I was blind before, or it magically works this time...) 
                // There is an error in trexp (A.SeqExp expList) that causes loss of the a:=a+1 statement
    test27.tig  // Mostly good, but I think there are some details regarding function calls that may be wrong.  
                // It would have to be clarified with Meehan
    test30.tig  // Array indexing looks great
    test37.tig  // There seems to be extra nested ESEQ, but they should be cleared up in the cononicalizing step
    test41.tig
    42          // FIXED Need to fix allocRecord
    44          // we don't handle nil records, oops
    46          // again, nils

Can't test Files:

Chapter 7, things that I understand and so I know they work:

1. if statements

Things I don't understand and so don't know if they work:

1. function call, static links (I think I believe it now)
